<h1><strong>Welcome to your digital German Journal!</strong></h1> 

This app will allow you to record a running journal of your daily thoughts and activities. The more German you write, the better your language skills will become! 

<h3><strong>Create A Journal</strong></h3>

In order to write a journal entry, simply click the "Create Journal" button. This will take you to a screen where you can write the date, a journal title, and the journal entry. 

Below the journal entry is a vocabulary section. This allows you to input one German word and it's English translation. Once you write your journal entry, you should select one word you used that you feel is important or interesting. 

Once you have written your journal entry and selected your vocabulary word, click the button at the bottom that reads "Create Journal Entry." 

<h3><strong>View Your Journals</strong></h3>

In order to view a running list of every journal you have written, click the "View Journals" button. On this page, you can see every journal you have written in chronological order. 

<h3><strong>Vocabulary Words</strong></h3>

If you click "Useful Vocabulary," the list begins with two words and their English translations. But you will add to this list every time you create a journal. A running list of every word you found helpful, interesting, or useful will appear here. You are encouraged to reference this list when writing your journal entries. 

<h3><strong>Roadmap of Components</strong></h3>

Below is a roadmap of the React components.
